# MadData IDE

## Overview

**MadData IDE** is an AI-powered technical interview platform designed to evaluate candidate behavioral signals during algorithmic programming challenges. It provides a real-time, interactive environment where candidates code, debug, and interact with an AI assistant, all while their telemetry is recorded for multi-dimensional analysis.

Unlike traditional coding assessments that focus solely on completion, MadData IDE leverages developer telemetry and prompt engineering analysis to produce deeper insights into a candidate's problem-solving process.
