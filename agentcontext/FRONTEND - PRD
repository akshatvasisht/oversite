---

# 12. MVP vs Post-MVP

## MVP

- Login
- Assigned questions page
- IDE layout
- AI assistant panel
- Submit flow
- Admin dashboard
- Score view

---

## Post-MVP

- Phase progress UI
- Real-time autosave indicator
- Session playback for admins
- Highlighting behavioral moments
- Dark mode
- Keyboard shortcuts

---

# 13. Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate refreshes during session | Restore state |
| Multiple tabs open | Lock second session |
| Submit with failing tests | Allow submit (behavioral eval independent) |
| Admin views incomplete candidate | Show status only |

---

# 14. Success Metrics (Frontend)

| Metric | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Session completion rate | >70% |
| Average time in IDE | ~60 min |
| AI panel usage rate | >80% sessions |
| Submit without crash | 99% success |

---

# Summary

Frontend responsibilities:

- Deliver a realistic AI-assisted coding environment
- Capture all user actions
- Guide user through clear session lifecycle
- Provide recruiter-facing transparency into scoring

The frontend must feel like a real interview IDE — not a demo — while remaining simple enough to ship within hackathon constraints.
