CONTEXT
-------
OverSite is an AI-assisted coding interview platform. Candidates solve algorithmic
problems inside a custom IDE that includes an AI coding assistant (Gemini). The
platform records every action taken during the session and scores candidates across
three dimensions (scale 1-5):

  Component 1 — Structural Behavior
    Captures how the candidate organized their problem-solving process.

  Component 2 — Prompt Quality
    Evaluates the specificity and quality of the candidate's AI interactions.

  Component 3 — Critical Review
    Measures how critically the candidate engaged with AI suggestions.
